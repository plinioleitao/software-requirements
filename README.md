# Welcome to Requirements Specification syllabus

## Description
This course provides an overview of software requirements.
Em particular, contexto de execução, definição e processos pertinentes.

### Context
- Overview of course
 - Evaluation
 - Practical work
  - Teams will choose a domain of interest and define the scope of a software system whose specification will be used as the evaluation.
- Introduction to requirements engineering
 - What is software requirements?
 - What is software requirements specification?
 - Types of requirements: user feature, detailed specification of system behaviour, a constraint (use of a particular programming language, algorithm).
 - What is the context?
  - System
  - Software
  - Why are requirements important?
 - Process
- What you will get?
 - Overview of requirements context

### Requirements classification (functional and quality requirements)
- We need to know what should be specified, right?
- Functional and quality requirements (ISO/IEC 25010)
- What expect at the end?
 - How requirements can be classified.
 - Some examples of requirements. 

### Stakeholders and viewpoints
- Whos´s interested in requirements?
- Why should I take that in account?

### Software requirements specification Standard
- Every document has a target user (content and form should reflect that).
- When to use? When the use of formal standards pays off? When is this use worth?
- ISO/IEC 29148:2011
- Guidelines for specs
- What you will get?
 - How should I register the requirements? What kind of document will be produced?

### Notations
- Formality vs informality
- Formal notations like Z
- Use case notation
- User stories (agile)
- Other notations (UML)
- Examples (use of)
- Results expected
 - Overview of exactly how a requerement is specified.

### Requirements process
- How things are done over time in a software development (focus on requirements)? Waterfall, iterative, agile processes.
- Detailed presentation of a software process with focus on requirements.
- ISO/IEC 29148:2011
